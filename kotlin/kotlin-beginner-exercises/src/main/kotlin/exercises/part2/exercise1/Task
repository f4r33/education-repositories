Exercise: Basic Zoo Management System

Objective:
Create a class hierarchy to represent animals in a zoo. You will create a base class named Animal and two derived classes named Bird and Mammal. Demonstrate the use of inheritance and how an overridden method can provide specific behavior for each subclass.
Requirements:

Define a base class Animal with the following:
    Properties: name (String) and age (Int).
    A constructor that takes name and age and initializes the respective properties.
    A method makeSound() that prints a generic sound.

Define a derived class Bird from Animal with the following:
    Override the makeSound() method to print a sound specific to birds (e.g., "Chirp").

Define another derived class Mammal from Animal with the following:
    Override the makeSound() method to print a sound specific to mammals (e.g., "Roar").

In the main function, create instances of Bird and Mammal, and call the makeSound method on each to demonstrate polymorphism.
