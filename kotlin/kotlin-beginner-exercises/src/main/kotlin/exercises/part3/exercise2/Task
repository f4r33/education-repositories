Exercise 2: Interface with Default Implementations and Polymorphism

Objective: Define an interface Transport with a default implementation for a method startEngine() that prints "Engine started".
Add methods drive() and stop(), which are abstract. Implement this interface in classes Car and Bicycle. For Bicycle, override startEngine to print "No engine to start".
