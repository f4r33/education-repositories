Exercise 3: Dynamic Museum Exhibit Display

Objective: You are tasked with creating a system for a museum exhibit display. The exhibit has various items: Painting, Sculpture, and Artifact. Each class has its unique properties and methods.
Your goal is to implement a function that takes any exhibit item and displays detailed information about it, handling the item appropriately based on its type.
If the type is unrecognized, it should print an error message.

    Define the base class ExhibitItem and derived classes for each type of item.
    Implement a displayItemDetails function that checks the type of the item and casts it to its specific type to access and display its properties.
    Demonstrate the function with instances of each item type.
