/**
 * Exercise: Error Handling in Coroutines
 *
 * Objective: Implement error handling within a coroutine to manage exceptions gracefully.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *     Exception Throwing: A coroutine should throw an exception intentionally.
 *     Exception Handling: Use try-catch within the coroutine to handle the exception.
 *     Reporting: Log the exception message and ensure the program does not crash.
 *     Expected Result: The coroutine handles the exception and the main program continues execution.
 *
 * Guidance for Implementation:
 *     Throw and Catch: Simulate an error scenario within a coroutine and catch it in the same context.
 *     Resilience: Demonstrate resilience by allowing the program to complete execution even after an error.
